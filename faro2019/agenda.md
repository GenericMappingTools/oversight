# Agenda for the Faro 2019 summit

First stab at a list of things that we want to discuss at the summit.

* Onboarding documentation for getting new users involved in the project.
* Place to ask questions once the GMT Wiki is retired.
* Growing the volunteer developer base: GMT Developer workshops
* Reorganize tests to allow more to be added without increasing time
* Develop coverage to ensure code is being adequately tested
* Find people who can be responsible for working on documentation
* Automate Windows builds for distribution
