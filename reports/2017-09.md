# Progress Report 2017-9-05

Since our last report we have worked on several parallel tracks:

* We have maintained the GMT 5.4 branch which is the current stable release branch,
  releasing 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 (the latest official release).
* We have incremented the major version number for GMT so that the next major GMT
  release will be GMT 6.0.0.
* We have made great progress on the GMT/Python package.
* We have published the GMT/MATLAB toolbox in *Geochem., Geophys., Geosyst.*

## Maintenance of 5.4

We continue to respond to bug reports which are addressed directly in the 5.4 branch,
then merged to trunk.  No new features are added to 5.4.x, hence it is deemed our stable
release.  The fink and macports distributions are distributing the latest 5.4.2 release
while most Linux distros are hopelessly stuck far back (e.g., 5.2.1).  We are unable to
speed that process up since it is up to the distributors and their policies.  We have
explained that 5.4.2 has less bugs and is more stable than 5.2.1 but to no avail.  We
must recommend that Linux users install from source.  We will try to reach out again to
the Linux maintainers we know to see what can be done.  We released a small update to
our coastline data base GSHHG in June (2.3.7).  This release updates the Northern
Mariana Islands with CUPS data from NOAA, adds two missing islands to northern Norway,
and adds in the missing Kosovo-Serbia boundary.  Leo and Paul also took part in the
annual GMTSAR workshop at Scripps where we helped strengthen GMTSAR and improve
processing and plotting scripts by using the latest GMT syntax for things like placing
color scales.  We anticipate releasing additional 5.4.x releases well into 2018 as GMT 6
goes through its development.

## GMT 6

The bulk of our time is spend developing GMT 6:

* As indicated during the last report, we are implementing modern mode (please see that
  report for more details).  In essence, this removes the responsibility of handling
  PostScript overlays (-O, -K, and redirection), dealing with repeated regions and
  projections (-R, -J), conversion of PostScript to other formats (PNG, PDF, etc), and
  introducing a new command to simplify subplots.  We are simultaneously addressing two
  contradictory demands by GMT users: Make it simpler, and don't change anything!  We are
  doing this by hiding the major changes under the modern mode, and keeping the classic
  mode as it has always been.  This will allow GMT users accustomed to classic mode (and
  their many scripts) to run as expected, while new users (and those who see the potential
  for major simplification by switching) will embrace modern mode.  We will present GMT
  Modern mode at the Fall AGU Meeting.
* We are also revamping all online examples so that they can be run via copy-and-paste
  by using files stored on the GMT cache server.  Note that not all improvements to GMT
  6 are under modern mode: There are plenty simplifications for classic GMT users,
  including URL, remote global grid service, improvement to -R (can now take country
  codes), full spherical math in grdmath for global grids, automatic shaded relief
  operations, and smaller (differential) gmt.conf files.
* Finally, Joaquim has experimented with opening up the world of proj4 projections via
  our GDAL bridge and it looks like this is a viable way to extend GMT to use proj4 with
  minimal fuss.  Eventually, GMT will only document the proj4 way of specifying
  projections but we will allow for backwards compatibility under the hood.

## Python package

Leo is making great progress on the Python API.  Many of the changes in GMT 6 are being
implemented in order to make the Python interface simple and "pythonic".  The code is
being developed on Github (https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt-python) and uses a
BSD 3-clause Open Source License, which is a common choice in the Python ecosystem.

This summer, Leo and Paul attended the SciPy 2017 Conference in Austin, TX (see the
[talk proposal](http://www.leouieda.com/blog/scipy2017-proposal-gmt.html) ,
[our initial design ideas](http://www.leouieda.com/blog/gmt-python-design.html), and the
[reviews for our abstract](http://www.leouieda.com/blog/scipy2017-reviews.html).
Leo presented the first instance of GMT/Python running in a Jupyter notebook.  A
recording of the talk is available on YouTube
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93M4How7R24).  Leo summarized in a blog post the
feedback received during the conference and the changes that were made to GMT/Python in
turn (http://www.leouieda.com/blog/gmt-after-scipy2017.html).

Leo has built GMT trunk packages for the conda package manager, which is commonly used
in Python (with a lot of help from [Filipe Fernandes](https://github.com/ocefpaf) and
[Mike Hearne](https://github.com/mhearne-usgs)).  The packages are built and distributed
through [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) community repository.  This helps to
setup continuous integration for GMT/Python, which requires GMT trunk, and will ease the
process of installing the Python package in the future.  Currently, there are packages
for Linux and OSX and Filipe is working on a Windows build
(https://github.com/conda-forge/gmt-feedstock/pull/15).

Leo will give a presentation on GMT/Python at the Fall AGU Meeting
(https://github.com/leouieda/agu2017).  Currently, Leo is working on data communication
between the GMT API and numpy arrays
(https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt-python/pull/44).
