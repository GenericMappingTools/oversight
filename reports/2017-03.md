# Progress Report 2017-3-28

Since the previous progress report (delivered live at Scripps during the summit in
August 2016; see link at bottom of page) there has been much activity.  Due to Wessel
going on a research cruise from November to January our quarterly report has been
delayed. Here are the biggest developments since the last report:

* We successfully carried out the recruitment of a post-doctoral researcher to take the
  lead on building the Python GMT module.  On February 15. 2017,
  [Dr. Leonardo (Leo) Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com) joined our team and is now working
  with Wessel at UH on this task.
* We have released several GMT versions (4.5.15, 5.3.0, 5.3.1., 5.3.2), culminating with
  version 5.3.3 on March 23, 2017.
* We have researched and procured a new GMT server that will allow us to implement
  **Continuous Integration** (automatic test suite every time repository changes, across
  all operating systems) and Florian is (remotely) configuring the new server.  We hope to
  move all server operations to the new server this spring, Florian's schedule permitting.
  Leo will also help with this task.
* We are addressing many of the topics that the steering committee brought to our
  attention (see link to their report at bottom of page).  One particular issues was the
  backwards compatibility.  This is a tricky issue because of finite resources.  We have
  to move forwards and some things will be left behind.  However, we will re-implement the
  old-style GMT 4 arrow symbol to allow existing GMT4 scripts to produce the expected
  plot, and we will hold our collective noses in the process.
* We are also making changes to simplify GMT.  To this end we are experimenting with a
  new **GMT_RUNMODE** setting which can be either *classic* or *modern*.  Classic is what
  you are all familiar with.  Modern adds numerous simplifications that especially new
  users will find very appealing (and even old-timers may like this).  I will elaborate on
  this below.  It is to a large extent driven by needs from the emerging standards for
  using GMT from MATLAB, Octave, Julia, and soon Python.
* We are starting to use the GMT API within the GMT modules more.  For instance,
  grdimage typically takes an external grid for intensities (shading) but in 99% of the
  cases this is derived from the grid to be imaged (via a separate grdgradient call).  We
  now have shorthands via grdimage's **-I** option that automatically calls grdgradient
  for you.  The same applies to grdview, and we are adding additional features through
  GMT.  This will become part of GMT 5.4.
* Both the GMT team and Dave Sandwell (GMTSAR) contributed sub-contract proposals to the
  National Geophysical Observatory proposal by UNAVCO.  If funded it will provide
  long-term support for GMT in that NGO will be the stewards of GMT and take over all the
  aspects of maintaining servers and wikis and offer workshops, leaving the GMT developers
  to what they are most suited for: develop and maintain.  Hopefully this will survive the
  Trump axes.

To give you an idea of what the modern mode entails, here are the highlights:

* The GMT cake-baking recipe of having to juggle **-O -K** is no longer used.  Those
  options are ignored.
* The *PostScript* that is being produced is maintained under the hood: there is no
  longer any redirection and appending to a file.
* Options **-R -J** are only needed the very first time to set the region and
  projection.  No longer need to give empty **-R -J** to indicate the previous setting.
* We are experimenting with auto-generating a valid **-R** from the input data itself.
* A plot is finalized when gmt psconvert is called.  It will produce whatever product
  the user wants, which may be the *PostScript* file but more likely the PDF or an image

As you can imagine, this greatly simplifies scripting and eliminates the two hardest
problems in GMT usage: Not mess up with **-O -K**, and not mess up with bad redirection
and appending.  Using this syntax by default in the new external APIs will make GMT more
appealing to such users as well. I expect that my next report this summer will give you
an update on this aspect.  Leo has started writing a Python script for converting
classic scripts to the modern syntax.  Our main concern is our 600+ test and
documentation scripts which follows a set layout (standardized way of assigning plot
output name, etc) but eventually it will handle any classic script.  The code for this
is hosted at https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmtmodernize.

For the GMT Team,
