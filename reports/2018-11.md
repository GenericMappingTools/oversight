# Progress Report 2018-11-6

Since our [last report in March, 2018](2018-03.md) we have continued work on several
parallel tracks:

* We have released our final GMT 4 version in July 2018, the GMT 4.5.18 release.
* We have maintained the GMT 5.4 branch which is the current stable release branch,
  releasing 5.4.4 (the latest official release) on July 1, 2018.
* We have ported all of our subversion repository and issue tracking to GitHub.
* We have secured some funding from EarthScope for the new modern mode.
* We are working on stabilizing GMT 6.0.0 beta and modern mode implementation.
* We have secured funding for the upcoming Portugal and California developer summits in 2019.

## Farewell to GMT 4.5.x

We have issued our final GMT 4 release this July 1.  This is version 4.5.18 and this
terminates our involvement with bug fixes and point releases for this series.  GMT 5
was released 5 years ago and any issues discovered in 4.5.18 need to be reproduced
in GMT 5 where we will make corrections.

## Maintenance of 5.4

Because all our development is now taking place in GMT 6, the 5.4 branch is only
updated when a bug is found.  We anticipate to make a 5.4.5 release shortly, which
has been held up by the GitHub transition. The 5.4.5 release will simplify
installation and building of the MB-system with GMT5 and 6.

## GMTSAR 2018 workshop

Wessel, Luis and Uieda attended the annual GMTSAR workshop at Scripps in August.
Due to a late conflict, Wessel missed most of the workshop but arrived on the
last day.  GMT developers then stayed the weekend at Scripps and collaborated
on GMT transition activities (below).

## GitHub Transition activities

During the GMTSAR 2018 workshop at Scripps, three of the GMT Developers (Wessel,
Luis, Uieda) spent a weekend where we ported the entire GMT 5/6 subversion
repository to GitHub. Using git will be the fourth version control system that
GMT has used over the decades (SCCS, CVS, subversion, now git).  The new
repository (https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt) is online at GitHub and
is independent of the University of Hawaii. We expect that this transition will make it
easier for community members to make contributions to the GMT code and documentation.
For now, only the source code and the issue tracking has been migrated, but we are
working on rebuilding the entire documentation process as well.  We have started
planning the first of two GMT developer summits to prepare our plans for how a GMT
transition can be accomplished. All six GMT developers are confirmed to attend the
summit which will be held in Faro, Portugal from January 20-27, 2019.  Being off-season
and with 3 developers in Europe, this was the cheapest and soonest meeting we could
have.

## GMT 6

With the move to GitHub we have laid the foundation for future development.
We have added Continuous Integration (CI) which means each time a pull request
is made the whole suite is compiled and tests are run to make sure the changes
in the pull request do not break anything in the repository.  GitHub also provides
an Issues list similar to our old Issues on the Wiki at SOEST.  We still need to
port older bug reports to GitHub as well as establish a forum similar to the one
at SOEST.  Finally, we need to automate the building of the documentation so that
we can move off the GMT server at SOEST.  By not relying on SOEST computers and
hosting we are making it easier for a community of developers and users to assist
with the maintenance of GMT.
GMT 6 is slowly getting more stable, and with the separate funding from EarthScope
we are implementing and testing the modern mode plus the new modules for movie
making (movie.c) and Google Earth quadtree imaging (grd2kml.c).  We hope GMT 6 beta
will be ready early in 2019.

## Summits in 2019

We have secured NSF funding for our two proposed summits.  At this point we have
made reservations for the GMT Developer Summit in Faro, Portugal for Jan 20-27,
taking advantage of very cheap rates for accommodation and travel.  During this
summit we will work up plans for the transition and these will be circulated do
the GMT Steering Committee as well as NSF.  We will incorporate their feedback
and prepare a White Paper on the GMT transition for further discussion at the
California Summit in the summer of 2019.

## Python package

Development of the Python wrapper has continued with added support for netCDF grids
through the [xarray library](http://xarray.pydata.org/), a new sphinx extension for
inserting GMT/Python plots into documentation, new module wrappers developed by new
contributors to the project, functions to download sample datasets, and better reporting
of C API errors.

The current implementation is running into a few limitations around building new module
wrappers and tutorial documentation. A re-implementation of some of the underlying code
is under way, which should make it easier to keep the documentation in sync with
examples and the GMT documentation.

## Outreach

Some of the GMT developers (Wessel, Luis, Uieda) met with a group of Scripps graduate
students and postdocs during the GMTSAR workshop to gather feedback and talk about GMT
development. In particular, they discussed opportunities for getting involved in the
project and how this process can be made more accessible. The overall reception was
positive and resulted in the some feedback filed as issues in the new Github repository.
We hope to keep this communication channel open to recruit new contributors in the near
future.

Uieda gave an update on the GMT/Python status at the 2018 Scipy Conference in July (a
recording of the talk is available on Youtube: https://youtu.be/6wMtfZXfTRM).
