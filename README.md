# GMT Oversight

As of August 2016, GMT development and maintenance is being guided by a GMT Steering
Committee:

* David Sandwell (Scripps) - Chair
* Louise Kellogg (UC Davis)
* Dave Caress (MBARI)
* Steve Diggs (Scripps)
* Dan Bassett (GNS Science, New Zealand)
* Khalid Soofi (ConocoPhillips)

## Updates

* March 2018: Louise Kellogg joined the Steering Committee.

## Reports

The GMT Team shall update the Steering Committee with timely reports. It has proven more
reasonable to provide these reports twice a year as a quarter is a bit too short to add
much new material.
